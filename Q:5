# 5. Write a program to display the average of three numbers entered by the user by 
creating a class named 'Average' having a function to calculate and display the 
average.

#include <iostream>

class Average {
public:
    // Function to calculate and display the average
    void calculateAverage() {
        double num1, num2, num3, avg;

        // Ask the user for input
        std::cout << "Enter three numbers: ";
        std::cin >> num1 >> num2 >> num3;

        // Calculate the average
        avg = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3;

        // Display the result
        std::cout << "The average of " << num1 << ", " << num2 << ", and " << num3 << " is " << avg << "." << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Average avgCalculator; // Create an object of the Average class
    avgCalculator.calculateAverage(); // Call the function to calculate and display the average
